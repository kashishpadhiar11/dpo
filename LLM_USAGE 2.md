# LLM_USAGE.md

This document logs all instances where AI/LLM assistance was used during the development of this project.

---

## 1. Code Generation & Assistance

- **Project structure, initial files, and boilerplate code** were generated with the help of an AI assistant (ChatGPT/GPT-4).
- **Data preprocessing functions** (for extracting questions and stepwise solutions from the prm800k dataset) were written with AI guidance.
- **Data collator and training script** templates were generated with AI assistance, then adapted for this project.
- **Bug fixing and error resolution** (e.g., handling tokenization, batch size, and memory issues) were performed with the help of an AI assistant.
- **README.md and documentation** were drafted and improved with AI suggestions.

## 2. Commit Messages

- All code generated or significantly influenced by AI is accompanied by clear commit messages and is documented here.

## 3. Notes

- No model weights or outputs were generated by an LLM; all training was performed locally using open-source models.
- All code was reviewed and adapted as needed for correctness and project requirements.
